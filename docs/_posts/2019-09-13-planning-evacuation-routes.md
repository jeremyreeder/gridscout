If you should ever find yourself in need of evacuation, it'll help to have
planned a suitable route. This is how I do it.

### Destinations

In addition to the primary destination, it's important to have an alternate
destination. Preferably in the opposite direction, as this maximizes the
chance that the alternate destination remains viable when the primary becomes
unreachable. To locate each destination on an MGRS map, consider using
[GridScout Map™][gridscout-map].

### Routes

While it's helpful to know the fastest route, the route most useful here is
actually the one that is fastest _during peaks of traffic congestion_. Think
rush hour, with a few bad accidents.

In addition to your primary route to each destination, it's important to have
an alternate route in case the actual situation differs from the one in your
imagination. Preferably along a path which has no overlap with the primary
route, as this maximizes the chance that the alternate route remains viable
when the primary becomes impassable.

As an example, let's plan two routes from Sonna to Walters Ferry. There aren't
many good options for crossing the Snake River, but we can select bridges near
Melba (primary) and Marsing (secondary). Then we can plan two routes which
diverge immediately to separate highways and which do not meet at any point
until we reach our destination.
