I've been wondering about the relative security of various bend knots. By this
I mean how much force each knot can take before coming untied. So I did a
little experiment with eight bends tied in greased fishing line.

A related measure is how much each knot reduces the breaking strength of the
ropes in which it is tied. That's not what I'm trying to measure here. That's
why I chose a material that's intentionally super slippery, hoping that in most
cases I'd reach the security limit before I reach the strength limit. But alas,
some knots just won't slip.

I hoped and expected that my own invention, the Simple-Simon-crossover, would
perform exactly the same as the Simple-Simon-under.

### Results
| Bend Knot              | Limit (g) | Failure |
|------------------------|-----------|---------|
| Butterfly Bend         | 3056      | Break   |
| Simple Simon Under     | 2721      | Break   |
| Simple Simon Crossover | 2214      | Slip    |
| Simple Simon Over      | 1982      | Slip    |
| Simple Simon Double    | 1933      | Break   |
| Zeppelin Bend          | 1827      | Break   |
| Sheetbend              | 1089      | Slip    |
| Double Sheetbend       | 891       | Slip    |

I like the butterfly bend and find it easy to tie, so I'm happy to learn that
it holds so well. I'm surprised that the zeppelin did so much worse. I find it
a bit harder to tie and less versatile, so I'll stop bothering with it. As for
the Simple-Simon-crossover, it outperformed two of the original Simple-Simon
knots and is one of the easiest to tie.

My Simple-Simon-crossover bend outperformed all of the Simple-Simon knots
except the -under version. Since it's also the easiest Simple-Simon to tie,
this is pretty satisfying.

As expected, the sheetbend and double sheetbend slipped way too easily to be
worth using. What's surprising is that the double sheetbend actually did the
worst of these two.
