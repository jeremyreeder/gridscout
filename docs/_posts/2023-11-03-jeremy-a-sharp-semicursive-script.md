Discarding everything about how penmanship was taught to me as a child, I've
designed a new and improved handwriting script. It's more pointy and less
swoopy. I call it *Jérémesque*!

<div class="gallery" markdown="1">
![The way they taught me in school.][school-pangrams]
![How I'm doin' it now.][jeremy-pangrams]
*Before and After*
</div>

I like it. I find it to be nice-looking without silly frills, and to be easier
to read than the cursive script that I was originally taught without being any
harder to write.
