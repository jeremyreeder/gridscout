Inspired by [naval demolition trainees tying knots][underwater-test] —albeit
inferior ones— _underwater_, and also by firefighters doing it in thick fireproof
gloves, I present to you the GridScout™ tactile knot-tying challenge!


### Challenge

_Darkness_ may be a more practical obstacle. So, periodically, in a completely
dark room or with your vision of the rope otherwise obstructed, test your
ability to correctly tie each of the following knots.

Don't let me talk you out of tying knots underwater. You should totally do that too.

1. **[Double constrictor knot.][double-constrictor]**
In lieu of the inferior clove hitch or right-angle knot.

2. **[Simple-Simon-under bend.][simple-simon-under]**
At least 200% more secure than the sheetbend.

3. **[Alpine butterfly.][butterfly-loop]**
Excellent as a mid-rope loop, or as a "shank" to bypass a section of rope, or
as a "bend" to join ropes.

4. **[Zeppelin loop.][zeppelin-loop]**
A fixed loop for the end of a rope, better than the bowline in every way.

5. **[Cawley hitch.][cawley-hitch]**
A far more secure alternative to the taut-line hitch.

If you can properly tie great knots like these without even looking, then
you're good to go. It may not be as sexy as splicing det cord or as cool as
hoisting a carbide chainsaw up to a rooftop; but it's sexy enough, cool enough,
and downright useful in everyday life.
