Inspired by [naval demolition trainees tying knots][underwater-test] —albeit
inferior ones— _underwater_, and also by firefighters doing it in thick fireproof
gloves, I present to you the GridScout™ tactile knot-tying challenge!


### Challenge

_Darkness_ may be a more practical obstacle. So, periodically, in a completely
dark room or with your vision of the rope otherwise obstructed, test your
ability to correctly tie each of the following knots.

1. **[Double constrictor knot.][double-constrictor]**
In lieu of the inferior clove hitch or right-angle knot.

2. **[Simple-Simon-crossover bend.][simple-simon-crossover]**
172% more secure than the sheetbend.

3. **[Alpine butterfly.][butterfly-loop]**
Excellent as a mid-rope loop, or as a "shank" to bypass a section of rope, or
as a "bend" to join ropes.

4. **[Zeppelin loop.][zeppelin-loop]**
A fixed loop for the end of a rope, better than the bowline in every way.

5. **[Safety-belt hitch][safety-belt-hitch] (magnus variant).**
A friction hitch once used by steeplejacks to stop them from falling to their death. Still grippy enough to be downright useful.

If you can properly tie great knots like these without even looking, then
you're good to go. It may not be as sexy as splicing det cord or as cool as
hoisting a carbide chainsaw up to a rooftop; but it's sexy enough, cool enough,
and downright useful in everyday life.
