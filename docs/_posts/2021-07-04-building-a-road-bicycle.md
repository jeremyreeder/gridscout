It's Independence Day, and King George ain't gonna tell me what kind of bike to
ride. So I'm starting to build a custom road bike to get around on. Because
freedom, that's why. Flat, narrow bars; 35mm slicks; fork-mounted cargo rack;
and a big disc brake up front, controlled by the right hand as God and Edoardo
Bianchi intended. No rear brake and no front derailleur, I don't believe in
those.
