Inspired by [naval demolition trainees tying knots][underwater-test] —albeit
inferior ones— underwater, and also by firefighters doing it in thick fireproof
gloves, I present to you the GridScout™ knot challenge!


### Challenge

Darkness is to most of us a more practical obstacle. So, in a completely dark
room or with your vision of the rope otherwise completely obstructed, correctly
tie each of the following knots.


1. **[Double constrictor knot.][double-constrictor]**
In lieu of the inferior clove hitch or right-angle knot.

2. **[Simple-Simon-crossover bend.][simple-simon-crossover]**
172% more secure than the sheetbend.

3. **[Alpine butterfly][butterfly-loop]**
Excellent as a mid-rope loop, as a shank, or as a bend.

4. **[Zeppelin loop][zeppelin-loop]**
A fixed loop for the end of a rope, better than the bowline in every way.

5. **[Sub-lieutenant's hitch][sublieutenants-hitch]**
A secure adjustable loop with more grip than the midshipman's hitch.
