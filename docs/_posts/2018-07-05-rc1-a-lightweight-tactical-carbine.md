I'm building a new weapon which I call the GridScout RC1. Why RC1? Because it's easier to
explain that RC1 stands for Reeder Carbine #1 than to explain that PK6 (its
original name) stands for _Piŝta Karabeno je 6,5 Grendel_.

## Weapon design
I want a gun that's especially easy to handle in close-quarters combat without
sacrificing effectiveness at medium range (up to 500 yards). While many PDWs
are great in close quarters and a modern carbine is pretty good up
to 300 yards, both are severely handicapped beyond that range. PDWs
suffer from their very short barrels, while the typical carbine is
held back by a diminutive 5.56x45 NATO cartridge. In
either case, the energy of the bullet is insufficient to remain effective
at my maximum intended distance against human targets and the occasional
medium-size game animal. (Besides the obvious counterterrorism missions, I
intend to hunt wolves, deer, and wild boar with this puppy.)

As an illustration that 5.56x45 won't do, consider that at 500 yards it will
have lost 68% of its kinetic energy, reducing it to just 541 ft·lb. While
there's no _universal_ agreement on how much it takes to do the job well, I
set my requirement at 800 ft·lb based on the guidance of [Chuck Hawks][hawks].
A 6.5 Grendel cartridge exceeds this slightly at 500 yards, giving 818 ft·lb;
whereas the lighter and less streamlined 5.56mm cartridge can comply only out
to 300 yards. (Calculations based on Wolf™ Military Classic cartridges — 6.5
Grendel, 100gr, [0.515 BC][grendel-bc], 2723 ft/s MV; vs .223 Remington, 55gr,
0.395 BC, 3241 ft/s MV.)

I'd like to conquer these goals by creating a custom carbine, so I'm going for
it. When it's finished, we'll see how it performs.

### Basis
The RC1 design is based somewhat on the [Alexander™ 6.5 Grendel
Incursion][incursion], which is relatively light and fires one of the most
effective general-purpose cartridges yet devised for modern sporting rifles.
The Incursion, however, isn't everything that I want it to be.

It's slightly longer than I prefer in close quarters, and it still relies on
the direct-impingement gas system that got M16 operators killed in Vietnam.

But thanks to the versatility and popularity of Eugene Stoner's modular AR-15
design —upon which the M16 and the Incursion are based—, we now have a
standardized means of interchanging parts to fit the needs and wants of the
shooter. The RC1 will take advantage of this in two important ways.

- Certain part selections, inspired by PDWs and by AR15A3-derived ultralight
  carbines, will serve to make the RC1 lighter and more maneuverable.

- The bolt will be cycled by a gas piston, based on the Armalite AR-180 design,
  which has proven substantially more reliable than direct gas impingement.

Piston gas systems consistently outperform direct-impingement systems in
reliability tests, as they did in a [2007 test by the U.S.Army][test-results].

### Barrel
The barrel of the RC1 will be of the standard 16" carbine length, just long
enough to avoid the red tape associated with a short-barreled rifle. This
length also produces high enough muzzle velocity and bullet energy for
practical medium-range use. If I use a muzzle brake, it will be a short,
single-chamber model to minimize the added weight and length.

### Buttstock
The RC1 will have a very short, fixed-length buttstock to shift its mass closer
to the shooter's body where it's most easily supported.  With the 33° grip
angle that's most common in modern carbines, this position would be
uncomfortable for the wrist of the shooter's dominant hand; so the RC1's grip
will instead be nearly vertical as in a PDW. This weapon will be as lightweight
as practicable, in order to limit muscle fatigue so the shooter can more easily
keep his sights steady on the target.

### Sights
The RC1 will be equipped with two sighting systems:
- A lightweight fixed-power riflescope, for 100- to 500-yard engagements
- Simple offset iron sights for quick target acquisition within 100 yards

## Progress
Progress on this project is as follows. With a scope and a
full magazine, I anticipate a total weight of about 6 lb 13 oz, and a total
length of about 32 inches.

![This Anderson™ AM-15 receiver set (8.7-oz lower, 6.7-oz slick-side upper) from Wisconsin has no ejection-port cover and no forward assist, frills which in my view aren't worth their weight. The receivers are held together by 2A Armament™ titanium takedown pins made in southeast Boise, adding 0.1 oz.][progress-2018-06-21]
![The TacStar™ 10" carbon-fiber handguard weighs in at 7.3 oz, mounting hardware included.][progress-2018-06-22]
![This 5.9-oz E-Lander™ magazine from Israel is made of steel, making it stronger than the aluminum USGI models that are prone to bending of the feed lips.][progress-2018-11-14]

![This carbon-fiber buttstock, produced by Incognito Arms™ within spitting distance of my daily commute through Boise, weighs just 2.33 oz. The 13° Ergo™ Swift Grip (2.8 oz with included screw) notably has no backstrap, so the palm can grip the gun higher for recoil management and easier reach of the magazine release. I've also installed an Alexander™ Incursion melonited chromoly barrel (1 lb 7.9 oz), Aero™ barrel nut (1.3 oz), and TacStar™ handguard (7.3 oz with included hardware). The barrel came with an Alexander™ "hard-use" bolt assembly (1.5 oz), which in the absence of a bolt carrier is not yet installed.Total weight as pictured is 3 lb 5 oz.][progress-2018-12-25]

The lower is now complete. Total weight so far is 4 lb 9 oz. Projected total
weight when complete and fully loaded is now 7 lb 3 oz. That's 6 oz heavier
than originally anticipated, so I better start workin' out. ;)

## Performance
When the RC1 is complete, we'll assess its performance in a separate post, a
link to which will be conveniently provided here. Things to be considered in
the assessment include:
- Muscle fatigue from a long day of shootin' stuff up
- Ease of maneuvering in close quarters
- Ability to reliably hit the vital areas of:
  - Wolf-size targets at 50 yards with iron sights, from standing position
  - Wolf-size targets at 100 yards with iron sights, from kneeling position
  - Man-size targets at 100 yards with scope, from standing position
  - Man-size targets at 500 yards with scope, from prone position
