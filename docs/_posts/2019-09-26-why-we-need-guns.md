"A well-regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the
right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed."

— Constitution of the United States, 2nd Amendment
</div>

We the People are responsible for our own security. That responsibility cannot
reasonably be delegated to any government. I have two reasons for this
position:

1. **It is infeasible for a government to provide adequate security to respond
to immediate threats against each individual.** The best it can do is to
prioritize whom to protect. Forgive me if I'm uncomfortable with the notion of
allowing my family and others around me to be deemed expendable when I myself
am capable of providing security.

2. **It is highly dangerous to allow a government to entertain notions of
superiority over its People, of a rightful monopoly on possession of certain
property, and of the right to forcibly establish such a monopoly.** Such an
abolishment of freedom, if applied to possession of the weaponry necessary for
our defense, will inevitably lead to more massacres and other atrocities.
Whether these future attacks are perpetrated by private criminal entities or by
the government itself, they pose a serious threat.

So let's keep our security. Let's remain free. Let's not subject ourselves to
violent attacks or to unjust rule which puts are lives in jeopardy. Let's not
ever give up our rightful defenses, no matter how nicely our leaders may try to
paint that picture.
