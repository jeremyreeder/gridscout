title: Tying the zeppelin knots

The zeppelin bend is a good knot for joining two ropes together. The zeppelin
loop is a good knot for making a fixed loop. This is how I tie them.

# Zeppelin bend
{:#bend}

This bend won't slip or shake loose, ever. It reduces the breaking strength of
a rope by only 25%. And it remains easy to untie after being subjected to an
extreme load, although not _while_ loaded. To tie it:

1. Take one end of each rope, and drape them over your index finger as
illustrated.

2. Take the end of the left rope _under_ its standing part, _over and under_
the end of the right rope, then back under itself to form an overhand knot
around both ropes.

3. Take the end of the right rope around _behind_ the index finger and _under
both ropes to form another overhand knot around them.

4. Pull the standing parts, then the ends.

For contrast, consider that the sheetbend reduces a rope's breaking strength by
a whopping 55% and that in synthetic rope it slips before even reaching that
limit. I recently tested the security of the zeppelin bend, the sheetbend, and
six other bends. [See how they compare.][bend-test]

# Zeppelin loop
{:#loop}

This fixed loop knot shares the zeppelin bend's excellent qualities. To tie it:

1. Tie an overhand knot some distance from the end of the rope, then pass the
end around an object (optionally) and back through the far opening in the
overhand knot as illustrated.

2. Pass the end through the loop as illustrated.

3. Pass the end through the near opening in the overhand knot as illustrated
and under its own standing part.

4. Pull the standing part, then pull the end.

</div>

A worthy alternative to the mediocre bowline loop, the zeppelin loop is derived
from the zeppelin _bend_ in the same way that the bowline is derived from the
sheetbend.
