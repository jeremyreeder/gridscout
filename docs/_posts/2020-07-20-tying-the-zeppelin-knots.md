title: Tying the zeppelin knots

The zeppelin bend is a good knot for joining two ropes together. The zeppelin
loop is a good knot for making a fixed loop. This is how I tie them.

# Zeppelin bend
{:#bend}

This bend won't slip or shake loose, ever. It reduces the breaking strength of
a rope by only 25%. And it remains easy to untie after being subjected to an
extreme load, although not _while_ loaded. To tie it:

1. Near the end of the first rope, make a turn around your hand.

2. Do the same with the second rope in the opposite direction, positioning the
rope ends at opposite ends of your hand.

3. Pass the end of one rope over the other rope, then through both ropes where
your hand is.

4. Do the same with the other rope.

5. Pull the standing parts, then pull the ends. Repeat till tight.

For contrast, consider that the sheetbend reduces a rope's breaking strength by
a whopping 55% and that in synthetic rope it slips before even reaching that
limit. I recently tested the security of the zeppelin bend, the sheetbend, and
six other bends. [See how they compare.][bend-test]

# Zeppelin loop
{:#loop}

This fixed loop knot shares the zeppelin bend's excellent qualities. To tie it:

1. Tie an overhand knot some distance from the end of the rope, then pass the
end around an object (optionally) and back through the far opening in the
overhand knot as illustrated.

2. Pass the end through the loop as illustrated.

3. Pass the end through the near opening in the overhand knot as illustrated
and under its own standing part.

4. Pull the standing part, then pull the end.

</div>

This is a worthy alternative to the mediocre bowline loop. It is derived from
the zeppelin bend in the same way that the bowline is derived from the
sheetbend.
