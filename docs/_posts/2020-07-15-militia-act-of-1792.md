The [Second Militia Act of 1792][act] was passed by the second U.S. Congress and
President Washington. It requires each of us dudes to "be enrolled in the
militia"; and to "provide himself with a good musket or firelock, …bayonet,
[and] not less than twenty four cartridges…; or with a good rifle, …twenty
balls…, and a quarter of a pound of powder"; and to "appear so armed … when
called out to exercise or into service".

This mandate still applies. It has been lawfully amended to apply even more
broadly. Arm yourselves well, and be ready. It's your duty.

There are those who claim that other supposed laws supersede this statute and
even that they override the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. They
would mandate the opposite, that you be _disarmed_ and useless in the defense
of your family and community. That is absurdity.
