title: Knots that actually hold

Some knots in common use have never been all that good. Others have grown less
secure as we've turned to synthetic ropes. These ropes are strong and resist
rotting, but they're a bit slippery. So we just can't keep depending on knots
that kinda sorta worked in the 19th century. Here's a list of loops, shanks,
bends, bindings, and hitches that'll actually hold in modern rope.

The knots that I consider the worst offenders are the sheepshank, sheetbend,
half hitch, clove hitch, and double-slipped reef knot.

### Loops
- **[Cossack loop.][cossack-loop]** Use at the end of a rope in place of a
  bowline loop. More secure and just as easy to untie. Favored by Russians and
Eskimos.
- **[Flemish loop.][flemish-loop]** Use at the end of a rope or in the middle.
  Fastest fixed loop to tie and, with its figure-eight shape, the easiest to
verify. A pain to untie after stressing though.
- **[Alpine butterfly loop.][butterfly-loop]** Use in place of Flemish loop in
  the middle of a rope. Easiest loop to untie after stressing.


### Shanks
- **Butterfly shank.** Use alpine butterfly in place of sheepshank, which is
  the best known but most unreliable of shanks, lest you die.


### Bends
- **[Simple-Simon-under bend.][simple-simon-under]** Use in place of sheetbend
  for joining slippery or dissimilar ropes. As easy as the name suggests.
- **[Vice-versa bend.][vice-versa-bend]** Use in place of sheet bend for
  joining stretchy rope.
- **Butterfly bend.** Use alpine butterfly in place of sheetbend wherever ease
  of untying after extreme stress is valued more than tidiness.
- **[Zeppelin bend.][zeppelin-bend]** Use anywhere you'd use the alpine
  butterfly bend, such as when mooring blimps.


### Bindings
- **[Double constrictor knot.][double-constrictor]** The most manly of
  bindings. Use in place of clove hitch or right-angle knot.
- **Slipped double constrictor knot.** Use in place of temporary clove hitch.
- **[Strangle knot.][strangle-knot]** Use in place of one or two half-hitches to lock any
  unfinished knot.
- **Double-throw reef knot.** A symmetric variant of the surgeon's knot. Use in
  place of reef knot, especially when it can't be relied upon to remain pressed
  against a convex surface, or when using stretchy rope.
- **Double-slipped double-throw reef knot.** Use in place of double-throw
  reef-knot for a secure quick-release bow.
- **Reef knot in two bights.** Use in place of double-slipped reef knot for a
  semi-permanent bow.

I fasten my pajama pants with a double-slipped double-throw reef knot and my
running shoes with a reef knot in two bights.

### Hitches
- **Double constrictor knot, or slipped variant.** This binding serves well as
  a simple hitch.
- **[Trucker’s hitch (fixed-loop variant, securely locked).][truckers-hitch]**
  Start with a secure binding. Follow that with a fixed loop. Pass the end around
  an object and back through the loop. Pull the end back toward the object,
  enjoying a 3:1 mechanical advantage. Fasten the end temporarily to the standing
  part with a half-hitch immediately adjacent to the loop. Then lock it with a
  secure binding.
