Some knots in common use have never been all that good. Others have grown less
secure as we've turned to synthetic ropes. These ropes are strong and resist
rotting, but they're a bit slippery. So we just can't keep depending on knots
that kinda sorta worked in the 19th century. Here's a list of loops, shanks,
bends, bindings, and hitches that'll actually hold in modern rope.

FYI, the worst offenders are the sheepshank, sheetbend, half-hitch, clove
hitch, and shoelace knot.

### Loops

- **[Cossack loop.][cossack-loop]**
Use at the end of a rope in place of bowline loop. Favored by Russians and
Eskimos.

- **[Flemish loop.][flemish-loop]**
Use at the end of a rope or in the middle.  One of the fastest fixed loops to
tie and, with its figure-eight shape, the easiest to verify. A bit of a pain to
untie after stressing though.

- **[Alpine butterfly loop.][butterfly-loop]**
Use in place of Flemish loop in the middle of a rope, if ease of untying is
important.


### Shanks
- **Butterfly shank.**
Use alpine butterfly in place of sheepshank, which is the best known but most
unreliable of shanks, lest you die.

The point of a shank is to bypass a section of rope that is damaged or overly
long. A shank that easily shakes loose obviously won't do.

### Bends
- **[Simple-Simon-under bend.][simple-simon-under]**
Use in place of sheetbend for joining slippery or dissimilar ropes. About as
easy as the name suggests.
- **[Vice-versa bend.][vice-versa-bend]**
Use in place of sheetbend for joining stretchy rope.
- **Butterfly bend.**
Use alpine butterfly in place of sheetbend wherever ease of untying after
extreme stress is valued more than tidiness.
- **[Zeppelin bend.][zeppelin-bend]**
Use anywhere you'd use the butterfly bend, like when mooring blimps.

I tested the security of eight bends. Check out the [results][bend-test].

### Bindings
- **[Double constrictor knot.][double-constrictor]** The most manly of
bindings. Use in place of clove hitch or right-angle knot. The old-timers say
you have to cut it off; but with synthetic rope, untying is often perfectly
feasible.
- **Slipped double constrictor knot.** Use in place of clove hitch as a secure
but easily untied binding.

- **[Strangle knot.][strangle-knot]**
Use in place of one or two half-hitches to lock any unfinished knot.
- **Double-throw reef knot.**
Variant [H2H2s][surgical-knot-study] of the surgeon's knot. Simply a reef
knot with its two halves converted to double overhand knots by an additional
pass through the center. Consider using in place of reef knot, especially
against a non-convex surface or in stretchy rope.
- **Reef knot in two bights.**
For a decorative shoelace bow that'll stay tied all day: first fold the ends
over to form bights, then simply tie them in a reef knot.

Most people use a standard shoelace knot (double-slipped reef), but it works
loose easily. The reef knot's grip seems to rely on its symmetry, and using
bights for only half of the knot disrupts that symmetry.

### Hitches

- **Double constrictor knot, or slipped variant.**
This binding serves well as a simple hitch.

- **[Camel hitch.][camel-hitch]**
Consists of two double-throw half-hitches. Use to hitch your camel, or anywhere
that your 19th-century counterpart would've used two half-hitches or a rolling
hitch.

- **Sub-lieutenant's hitch.**
When the camel hitch is tied around the standing part, it forms a secure
adjustable loop. Use in place of midshipman's hitch to tie down an aircraft or
to tension a guyline. Sub-lieutentant is the rank directly above midshipman in
the Royal Navy, so I consider this an apt name for this improvement upon the
midshipman's hitch.

I just made that one up. You're welcome.

- **Trucker’s hitch (fixed-loop variant, securely locked).**
Everybody ties this differently. Here's one that stays put. Make a fixed
upper loop (e.g. alpine butterfly). Pass the end around an object and through
the upper loop. Then tie a camel hitch around the resulting lower loop and
cinch it tight.
