Some knots in common use have never been all that good. Others have grown less
secure as we've turned to synthetic ropes. These ropes are strong and resist
rotting, but they're a bit slippery. So we just can't keep depending on knots
that kinda sorta worked with the tarred hemp ropes of the 19th century. Here's
a list of loops, shanks, bends, bindings, and hitches that'll actually hold in
modern rope.

FYI, the worst offenders are the sheepshank, sheetbend, half-hitch, clove
hitch, and shoelace knot.

### Fixed loops

- **[Zeppelin loop.][zeppelin-loop]**
Use at the end of a rope in place of bowline loop.

- **[Flemish loop.][flemish-loop]**
Use at the end of a rope or in the middle.  One of the fastest fixed loops to
tie and, with its figure-eight shape, the easiest to verify. A bit of a pain to
untie after stressing though.

- **[Alpine butterfly loop.][butterfly-loop]**
Use in place of Flemish loop in the middle of a rope, if ease of untying is
important.


### Shanks
- **Butterfly shank.**
Use alpine butterfly in place of sheepshank, which is the best known but most
unreliable of shanks, lest you die.

The point of a shank is to bypass a section of rope that is damaged or overly
long. A shank that easily shakes loose obviously won't do.

### Bends
- **[Simple-Simon-under bend.][simple-simon-under]**
Use in place of sheetbend for joining slippery or dissimilar ropes. About as
easy as the name suggests. Its ends are tidily parallel to its standing parts,
convenient if you have to reeve the knot through an eye.
- **[Vice-versa bend.][vice-versa-bend]**
Use in place of sheetbend for joining stretchy rope. Tidy like the Simple
Simon.
- **Butterfly bend.**
Use alpine butterfly in place of sheetbend wherever ease of untying after
extreme stress is valued more than tidiness.
- **[Zeppelin bend.][zeppelin-bend]**
Use anywhere that you might use the butterfly bend, especially in stretchy
rope. The untidiest of the bunch, but the most easily untied.

I tested the security of eight bends. Check out the [results][bend-test].

### Bindings
- **[Double constrictor knot.][double-constrictor]**
The most manly of bindings. Use in place of clove hitch or right-angle knot.
The old-timers say you have to cut it off; but with synthetic rope, untying is
often perfectly feasible.
- **Slipped double constrictor knot.**
Use in place of clove hitch as a secure but easily untied binding.

- **Double-throw reef knot.**
Variant [H2H2s][surgical-knot-study] of the surgeon's knot. Simply a reef
knot with its two halves converted to double overhand knots by an additional
pass through the center. Consider using in place of reef knot, especially
against a non-convex surface or in stretchy rope.

- **Reef knot in two bights.**
For a decorative shoelace bow that'll stay tied all day: first fold the ends
over to form bights, then simply tie them in a reef knot.

</div>

Most people use a standard shoelace knot (double-slipped reef), but it works
loose easily. The reef knot's grip seems to rely on its symmetry, and using
bights for only half of the knot breaks that symmetry. So use this two-bight
version, or just the [classic reef knot with shorter laces][short-shoelaces].

### Hitches

- **Double constrictor knot (or slipped variant).**
This binding serves well as a simple pole hitch.

- **[Schwabisch hitch.][schwabisch-hitch]**
A friction hitch suitable for connection to a life-support line in case you
fall.

- **[Cawley hitch.][cawley-hitch]**
A good friction loop. Use in place of the midshipman's hitch or taut-line
hitch, for use in tensioning guylines or mooring a jet-ski. To tie down an
aircraft, use nested pairs of Cawley hitches.

I tested eight friction loops. Check out the [results][friction-loop-test].

- **Trucker’s hitch (butterfly variant finished with Cawley hitch).**
Use this compound hitch to secure a heavy load.

	1. Make a fixed upper loop with the alpine butterfly. Tie it far enough from your final anchor point to allow room for cinching.
	2. Pass the working end around the anchor point. This forms a lower loop.
	3. Hook onto the upper loop with a Cawley hitch.
	4. Adjust the Cawley hitch to tension the lower loop.

### Different strokes for different ropes

Different types of cordage present different challenges.

- **Good knots for flat straps** (coming)
