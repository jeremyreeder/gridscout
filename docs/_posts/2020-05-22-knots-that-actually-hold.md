Some knots in common use for ages have never been all that trustworthy. And
while modern synthetic ropes have some exceptional qualities, their
relative slipperiness makes the insecurity of certain knots all the more
obvious. Here's a list of knots that'll actually hold.

### Bindings
- **[Double constrictor knot.][double-constrictor]** The most manly of
  bindings. Use in place of clove hitch or right-angle knot.
- **Slipped double constrictor knot.** Use in place of temporary clove hitch.
- **[Reef knot.][reef-knot]** Use in place of double-slipped reef knot when you can do
  without a pretty bow.
- **Double-throw reef knot.** A symmetric variant of the surgeon's knot. Use in
  place of reef knot that won’t remain pressed against a convex surface, or
  when using stretchy rope.
- **Reef knot in two bights.** Use in place of double-slipped reef knot for a
  semi-permanent bow.
- **Double-slipped double-throw reef knot.** Use in place of double-throw
  reef-knot for a secure quick-release bow.
- **[Overhand knot.][overhand-knot]** Use around standing part adjacent to half-hitch, as a
  means of securing the half-hitch's weak lock. Or use around standing part
  close to running end, to keep the end from whipping around.
- **[Strangle knot.][strangle-knot]** Use in place of one or two half-hitches to lock any
  unfinished knot.

### Stoppers
- **[Figure-9 stopper.][figure-9]** Just bulky enough.

### Hitches
- **[Double constrictor knot.][double-constrictor]** This binding serves well as
  a simple hitch.
- **[Trucker’s hitch (fixed-loop variant)][truckers-hitch].** Start with a
  secure binding. Follow it with a fixed loop. Pass the end around an object
  and through the loop. Pull the end toward the object, enjoying a 3:1 mechanical
  advantage. Lock the end to the standing part with a half-hitch adjacent to the
  loop, then further secure it with an overhand knot.

### Bends
- **[Simple Simon under bend.][simple-simon-under]** Use in place of sheet bend
  for joining slippery or dissimilar ropes. As easy as the name suggests.
- **[Vice-versa bend.][vice-versa-bend]** Use in place of sheet bend for
  joining stretchy rope.
- **[Alpine butterfly bend.][butterfly-bend]** Use in place of sheet bend
  wherever ease of untying after extreme stress is valued more than the
tidiness of a rope.
- **[Zeppelin bend.][zeppelin-bend]** Use anywhere you'd use the alpine
  butterfly bend, such as when mooring blimps.

### Loops
- **Cossack loop.** Use at the end of a rope in place of a bowline loop. More
  secure and just as easy to untie. Favored by Russians and Eskimos.
- **Flemish loop.** Use at the end of a rope or in the middle. Fastest fixed
  loop to tie and, with its figure-eight shape, the easiest to verify. A pain
  to untie after stressing though.
- **[Alpine butterfly loop.][butterfly-loop]** Use in place of Flemish loop in
  the middle of a rope. Easiest loop to untie after stressing.

### Shanks
- **Alpine butterfly shank.** Use in place of sheepshank, which is the best
  known but most unreliable of shanks, lest you die.
