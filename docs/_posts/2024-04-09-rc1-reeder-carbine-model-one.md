I built a new weapon. I call it the **RC1**. Why that name? Because it's easier
to explain that RC1 stands for _Reeder Carbine Model One_ than to explain that
PK6 (its original name) stands for _Piŝta Karabeno je 6,5mm Grendel_.

## Weapon design

I want a gun that's especially easy to handle in close-quarters combat without
sacrificing effectiveness at medium range (up to 500 yards). While a PDW may be
great in close quarters and an M4-style carbine is pretty good up to 300 yards,
both are severely handicapped beyond that range. A PDW's range suffers from its
very short barrel, while the carbine is typically held back by a diminutive
5.56x45 NATO cartridge. In either case, the energy of the bullet is
insufficient to remain effective at my maximum intended distance against human
targets and the occasional medium-size game animal. (Besides the obvious
counterterrorism missions, I intend to hunt wolves, deer, and wild boar with
this puppy.)

As an illustration that 5.56x45 won't do, consider that at 500 yards it will
have lost 68% of its kinetic energy, reducing it to just 541 ft·lb. While
there's no _universal_ agreement on how much it takes to do the job well, I
set my requirement at 800 ft·lb based on the guidance of [Chuck Hawks][hawks].
A 6.5 Grendel cartridge exceeds this slightly at 500 yards, giving 818 ft·lb;
whereas the lighter and less streamlined 5.56mm cartridge can comply only out
to 300 yards. (Calculations based on Wolf™ Military Classic cartridges — 6.5
Grendel, 100gr, [0.515 BC][grendel-bc], 2723 ft/s MV; vs .223 Remington, 55gr,
0.395 BC, 3241 ft/s MV.)

The RC1 design is based somewhat on the Alexander™ 6.5 Grendel Incursion, which
is relatively light and fires one of the most effective general-purpose
cartridges for modern carbines. The Incursion, however, isn't everything that I
want it to be. It's slightly longer than I prefer in close quarters, and it
still relies on the direct-impingement gas system that got M16 operators killed
in Vietnam.

But thanks to the versatility and popularity of Eugene Stoner's modular AR-15
design —upon which the M16 and the Incursion are based—, we now have a
standardized means of interchanging parts to fit the needs and wants of the
shooter. The RC1 takes advantage of this in two important ways.

- Certain part selections, inspired by PDWs and by AR15A3-derived ultralight
  carbines, serve to make the RC1 lighter and more maneuverable.

- The bolt is cycled by a gas piston, based on the Armalite AR-180 design,
  which has proven substantially more reliable than direct gas impingement.

Piston gas systems consistently outperform direct-impingement systems in
reliability tests, as they did in a [2007 test by the U.S.Army][test-results].

I'm targeting a length of 32" or less, and a weight of no more than 7 lb
all-inclusive.

## The Product

The build starts with a lightweight M4-style receiver set and
cartridge-specific magazines.

<div class="gallery" markdown="1">
![This Anderson™ AM-15 receiver set (8.7-oz lower, 6.7-oz slick-side upper) from Wisconsin has no ejection-port cover and no forward assist, frills which in my view aren't worth their weight. The receivers are held together by 2A Armament™ titanium takedown pins made in southeast Boise, adding 0.1 oz.][progress-2018-06-21]
![This 5.9-oz E-Lander™ magazine from Israel is made of steel, making it stronger than the aluminum USGI models that are prone to bending of the feed lips.][progress-2018-11-14]
*2018 — Receivers, pins, & magazine*
</div>

The barrel is of the standard 16" carbine length, just long enough to avoid the
red tape associated with a short-barreled rifle. This length also produces high
enough muzzle velocity and bullet energy for practical medium-range use.

![This carbon-fiber buttstock, produced by Incognito Arms™ within spitting distance of my daily commute through Boise, weighs just 2.33 oz. The 13° Ergo™ Swift Grip (2.8 oz with included screw) notably has no backstrap, so the palm can grip the gun higher for recoil management and easier reach of the magazine release. I've also installed an Alexander™ Incursion melonited chromoly barrel (1 lb 7.9 oz) and an Aero™ barrel nut (1.3 oz). The barrel came with an Alexander™ "hard-use" bolt assembly (1.5 oz), which in the absence of a bolt carrier is not yet installed. A TacStar™ handguard is pictured but turns out to be incompatible with the piston.][progress-2018-12-25]
*2018-12 — Buttstock, grip, & barrel*

<div class="gallery" markdown="1">
![The Fortis Clutch charging handle weighs in at 1.06 oz. It's single-sided, but this is the only side that has a real function in mil-spec charging handles anyway. As pictured, the weight is now 3 lb, 12.1 oz.][progress-2019-04-21T10]
![The endplate has a quick-detach mounting point for a sling. The ratcheting nut doesn't require staking. Both are produced by Primary Weapon Systems of Boise, just around the corner.][progress-2019-06-16T14:57]
*2019 — Charging handle & endplate*
</div>

This weapon has a very short, fixed-length buttstock to shift its mass closer
to the shooter's body where it's most easily supported. If it had the 33° grip
angle that's most common in modern carbines, then the short stock would make it
uncomfortable for the wrist of the shooter's dominant hand; so the grip is
instead nearly vertical as in a PDW. This weapon is meant to be as lightweight
as practicable, in order to limit muscle fatigue so the shooter can more easily
keep his sights steady on the target.

![Velocity™ 4-lb trigger, 3D-printed copolyester trigger guard, V7™ short-throw titanium selector, Seekins™ enlarged bolt-release paddle, Aero™ lower parts kit, ArmaSpec™ Stealth Recoil Spring.][progress-2020-06-22]
*2020-06 — Trigger & guard, selector, mag release, & assorted lower innards*

![This enormous mag-well flair, 3D-printed of carbon-fiber copolyester, makes my magazine changes so much faster.][progress-2020-06-25]
*2020-06-25 — Flaired magazine well*

The RC1 will be equipped with two sighting systems:
- A lightweight fixed-power riflescope (not yet mounted), for 100- to 500-yard engagements
- Simple offset iron sights for quick target acquisition within 100 yards

![Adams Arms™ lightweight bolt carrier, adjustable micro gas block, & piston][progress-2021-02-26]
![Adams Arms™ piston kit & GGG™ Transition rear sight. Also pictured is a plastic thread protector, but that'll be replaced with a steel one better suited for the heat.][progress-2021-03-02]
*2021-03 — Piston kit & rear sight*
</div>

To keep the overall length to a minimum, a simple thread protector is mounted on the barrel in lieu of a muzzle device.

![The carbon-fiber handguard lacked piston clearance, so I switched to this aluminum model by Intacto Arms. Also new is the steel thread protector by Down Range Products.][progress-2021-04-13]
*2021-04 — Handguard, front sight, & thread protector*

Upon firing, the gun wouldn't automatically load the next cartridge at first.
And charging the weapon manually was much harder than it ought to be. The
buffer tube seems to be a little shorter than standard, so the springs were
overly compressed. I resolved these troubles by replacing the ArmaSpec™ Stealth
Recoil Spring with a custom-tuned JP™ Silent Captured Spring.

The gun now functions properly. Its total length is 31
<sup>5</sup>/<sub>16</sub>". Good, it's under 32" like I wanted.

![Leupold™ 4x28 riflescope, mounted on cheap homemade prototype rings. Switched later to Leupold™ PRW2 rings.][progress-2024-04-01]
*2024-04 — Scope*

Total weight, with a scope and a full magazine, is 6 lb 15 oz. Good, it's under 7 lb like I wanted.
