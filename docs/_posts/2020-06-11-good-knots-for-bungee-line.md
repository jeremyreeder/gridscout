Bungee line and other super stretchy cordage can't be fastened securely with
traditional knots. They often slip at just 10% of breaking strength. But here are a few knots that work exceptionally well in
bungee line.

### Fixed loops

- **[Angler's loop.][anglers-loop]**
A good loop knot for permanent use, but nearly impossible to untie.

- **[Zeppelin loop.][zeppelin-loop]**
A secure loop knot that can actually be untied.


### Bends

- **[Vice-versa bend.][vice-versa-bend]**
Use for joining two bungee lines. The ends are tidily parallel to the standing
parts, convenient if you have to reeve the knot through an eye. Fairly
difficult to untie after heavily loading.

- **[Zeppelin bend.][zeppelin-bend]**
Use in place of the vice-versa bend wherever ease of untying after extreme
stress is valued more than tidiness.


### Stopper knots

- **[Stevedore knot.][stevedore-knot]**
Based on the figure-8 but with an extra wrap, this is a moderately bulky
stopper knot that stays put.
