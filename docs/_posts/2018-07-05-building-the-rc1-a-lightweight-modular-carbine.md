The ultimate purpose of the [GridScout™][gridscout] map-search tool is to
provide for a better community defense. For that same purpose, I'm building a
new firearm. I call it the RC1. Why RC1? Because it's easier to explain that
RC1 stands for Reeder Carbine #1 than to explain that PK6 (my original name for
the RC1 concept) stands for _Piŝta Karabeno je 6,5 Grendel_.

## Weapon design
My intent is to create a weapon that is especially easy to handle in
close-quarters combat without sacrificing effectiveness at medium range (up to
500 yards). While many PDWs are very good at close quarters and a typical
modern carbine is pretty good up to 300 yards, both are severely handicapped
beyond that range. The PDW's biggest hindrance in this regard is its very short
barrel, while the carbine is held back primarily by its use of the puny 5.56x45
NATO cartridge. In either case, the energy of the bullet is insufficient to
remain very effective throughout my intended range of distance to human
targets.

I think I can more fully achieve my chosen goals by creating a custom carbine
than by selecting any of the off-the-shelf offerings that I've already
considered. So I'm going for it, and upon completion we'll see how it does.

### Basis
The RC1 design is based somewhat on the [Alexander 6.5 Grendel
Incursion][incursion], which is relatively light and fires the most effective
general-purpose cartridge yet devised for AR15-format firearms. The Incursion,
however, isn't everything that I want it to be. It's slightly longer than I
prefer for close-quarters maneuvering. More importantly, it still relies on the
direct-impingement gas system that got M16 operators killed in Vietnam. But
thanks to the versatility and popularity of Eugene Stoner's modular AR-15
design —upon which the M16 and the Incursion are based—, we now have a
standardized means of interchanging parts to fit the needs and wants of the
shooter. The RC1 will take advantage of this in two important ways.

- The bolt will be cycled by a gas piston, based on the Armalite AR-180 design,
  which has proven substantially more reliable than direct gas impingement.
  (Piston gas systems consistently outperform direct-impingement systems in
  reliability tests, as they did in a [2007 test by the U.S.Army][test-results].)

- Other part selections, inspired by PDWs and by AR15A3-derived ultralight
  carbines, will serve to make the RC1 lighter and more maneuverable.

### Barrel
The barrel of the RC1 will be of the standard 16" carbine length, just long
enough to avoid the red tape associated with a short-barreled rifle. This
length also produces high enough muzzle velocity and bullet energy for
practical medium-range use. The muzzle brake will be a short, single-chamber
model to minimize the added weight and length.

### Buttstock
The RC1 will have a very short, fixed-length buttstock to shift its mass closer
to the shooter's body where it's most easily supported.  With the 33° grip
angle that's common in rifles and carbines, this position would be
uncomfortable for the wrist of the shooter's dominant hand; so the RC1's grip
will instead be nearly vertical as in a PDW. This gun will be as lightweight as
practical, in order to limit muscle fatigue so the shooter can more easily
keep his sights steady on the target.

### Sights
The RC1 will be equipped with two sighting systems:
- A lightweight fixed-power riflescope, practical for 100- to 500-yard
  engagements
- Offset iron sights, optimized for quick target acquisition

## Progress
Progress on this project is as follows. Initially, a few paper parts stand in
for some of the major parts that I have not yet acquired. With a scope and a
full magazine, I anticipate a total weight of about 6.8 pounds, and a total
length of about 32 inches.

![This Anderson receiver set (8.7-oz lower, 6.7-oz upper) from Wisconsin has no ejection-port cover and no forward assist, frills which frankly aren't worth their weight. The receivers are held together by 2A Armament titanium takedown pins made in southeast Boise, adding 0.1 oz. The TacStar 10" carbon-fiber handguard weighs in at 7.3 oz, mounting hardware included. I envision a short skeleton stock and a grip angle of about 14°.][2018-07-05]

![This Japanese fixed-power 6X scope, without mounting rings, weighs 9.8 oz.][2018-07-27]
*2018-07-27 — Weaver K6 scope (paper model)*

![This carbon-fiber buttstock, produced within spitting distance of my daily commute through Boise, weighs just 2.33 oz.][2018-07-31]
*2018-07-31 — Incognito Arms buttstock*

![This Israeli magazine weighs 5.9 oz. Up until this point, the magazine in photographs has been a paper model. The grip is still paper but now represents a 13° Ergo Swift Grip. Most importantly, this lacks the backstrap of the Tactical Link PDW grip pictured previously, putting the palm higher for better recoil control and farther forward to make all all finger controls easier to reach.][2018-11-14]

## Performance
When the RC1 is complete, I will assess the performance of this weapon in a
future post. I'll provide a link here to make it easy on you.
