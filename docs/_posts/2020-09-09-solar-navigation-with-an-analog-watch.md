TL;DR -- A Russian-style 24-hour watch, aligned with the equatorial plane and
aimed with a knife blade, makes a fantastic solar compass with 3° accuracy. Your inferior
12-hour watch will do fine too, with a bit of trickery.
{:.tangent .indent}

You probably already know some basic solar-navigation concepts, but these are
only rough approximations of the truth.
- The sun rises in the east and sets in the west.
- The sun is directly south at noon.

These approximations can be plenty misleading, so let's just call them LIES.
Here I present _actual_ truths about the position of the sun and a far better
way to use it to find directions. No equipment necessary except an analog
watch and a pocket knife.

### Lie #1: The sun rises in the east and sets in the west.

At my home near the 43<sup>rd</sup> parallel, trusting that the sun rises in
the east can mislead a fella by up to 34° in winter and summer. It's even less
accurate at higher latitudes. Here's how it _actually_ works:

Twice a year, at the equinoxes, the sun rises due east and sets due west.
But both the rising and the setting deviate northward as we
approach the June solstice, and southward for the
December solstice. You'll get at least 25° of deviation at each solstice,
depending on your latitude. Inside the polar circles, the sun won't
rise or set at all, it'll only circle around you just above or below the
horizon.

### Lie #2: The sun is directly south at noon.

Yeah, okay, but when is noon? Do you trust the government to tell you? Ha!
Today my solar noon came at 13:42 by the government-designated time, not 12:00.

Don't forget, of course, that in parts of the world the sun is _north_ at solar
noon. And in the tropics, it alternates.

## _True_ directions with a reverse sundial

Now that we've got those directional _lies_ out of the way, let's discuss how
to find the _truth_. The hour hand of a 24-hour analog watch follows the
apparent path of the sun very well as seen from above the north pole. So with
proper alignment, it comes in handy as a solar compass. With a little trickery,
even a 12-hour watch will do.

But first you'll have to know two things: your latitude, and what time on your
watch corresponds with solar noon. You can calculate solar noon or look it up.
Use 12:00 as a rough approximation _if you must_, or 13:00 during daylight
saving time.

One way to identify solar noon is to observe the shadow of a vertical pole over
time. At solar noon, the pole's shadow will be at its shortest of the day.
{:.tangent}

Next, you'll align your watch as a _reverse equatorial sundial_. Once aligned,
you'll know which direction you're facing because a sundial only reads the
right time when it's facing a particular direction. Whereas sundials are
usually pointed in that direction and _then_ used to determine the _time_, they
work equally well in reverse.

Read on to find out exactly _how_ to navigate with just an analog watch and a
pocket knife.

### Navigating with a 24-hour dial

Navigation is easiest with a 24-hour dial that shows daytime hours at the top
and nighttime at the bottom. This arrangement is common in Russian military
watches, and it generally allows you to navigate without removing the watch
from your wrist.

</div>

#### (when at or north of the equator)
1. Position the watch dial vertically with the solar noon time at the top.
2. Tilt the dial forward by an angle equal to your northern latitude.<sup>a</sup>
3. Rotate your body till the hour hand points toward the sun.<sup>b</sup>
4. You're now facing southward<sup>c</sup>.

<sup>a</sup> Just eyeball it, aiming to get within 6°.
{:.tangent .indent}

<sup>b</sup> If the sun is north of the equator, you can use a knife blade to
cast a shadow on the hour hand as an alignment guide. Otherwise, it may still
be helpful as an extension of the hour hand.
{:.tangent .indent}

<sup>c</sup> If you happen to be on the equator at solar noon on an equinox,
then all directions will seem to be south. Wait ten minutes.
{:.tangent .indent}

#### (when south of the equator)
1. Position the watch dial vertically with the hour hand at the top.
2. Tilt the dial forward by an angle equal to your southern latitude.<sup>a</sup>
3. Rotate your body till the solar noon position points toward the sun.<sup>d</sup>
4. You're now facing northward.

<sup>d</sup> When the sun is south of the equator, you can use a knife blade to
cast a shadow on the solar-noon position as an alignment guide. Otherwise, it
may still be helpful as an extended marker of solar noon.
{:.tangent .indent}

### Navigating with a 12-hour dial

Remember, it's easier with a _24-hour_ dial. If you dislike bisecting angles or
need an excuse to go watch-shopping, keep that in mind. But 12-hour watches are
more common, so here's how to make do.

#### (when at or north of the equator)

1. Position the watch dial vertically with the solar noon time at the top.
2. Tilt the dial forward by an angle equal to your northern latitude.<sup>e</sup>
3. Identify the sun's reference point on your dial. You'll find it halfway from solar noon to the hour hand, searching leftward from solar noon in the morning or rightward in the afternoon.
4. Rotate your body till the sun is aligned with its reference point.<sup>f</sup>
5. You're now facing southward.<sup>g</sup>

<sup>e</sup> Just eyeball it, aiming to get within 6°.
{:.tangent .indent}

<sup>f</sup> When the sun is on your side of the equator, you can use a knife
blade to cast a shadow on the dial as an alignment guide. Otherwise, it may
still be helpful as an extended marker of the reference point.
{:.tangent .indent}

<sup>g</sup> If you happen to be on the equator at solar noon on an equinox,
then all directions will seem to be south. Wait ten minutes.
{:.tangent .indent}

#### (when south of the equator)

1. Position the watch dial vertically with the hour hand at the top.
2. Tilt the dial forward by an angle equal to your southern latitude.<sup>e</sup>
3. Identify the sun's reference point on your dial. You'll find it halfway from the hour hand to solar noon, searching rightward from the hour hand in the morning or leftward in the afternoon.
4. Rotate your body till the sun is aligned with its reference point.<sup>f</sup>
5. You're now facing northward.

### How accurate is watch-based navigation?

Almost perfectly accurate in theory, and plenty accurate in practice. You can
reasonably expect to limit your maximum error to 3°.<sup>h</sup> As with any
other reverse equatorial sundial, accuracy depends primarily on your
identification of local solar noon and on fairly good alignment of your watch
dial with the equatorial plane.

<sup>h</sup> Assuming up-to-date knowledge of _solar noon_. Make that 7° if you
use _**mean** solar noon_. The distinction is given below.
{:.tangent}

#### Solar-noon error

I presume that your watch is set to _civil time_. 12:00 civil time is the
average _clock time_ at which the sun passes a particular government-specified
meridian. A useful reference, but it rarely coincides with the actual solar
noon of _your_ location. Due to irregular time-zone borders and daylight saving
time, civil time can easily be off by two hours, sometimes more.

The time on your watch that corresponds with solar noon will also vary a bit
over the seasons due to Earth's elliptic orbit, so you may just want to
remember what time it comes on Christmas Eve. That's _mean solar
noon_.<sup>i</sup> It'll get you within 16 minutes, or 4°.

<sup>i</sup> _Mean solar noon_ also coincides with _solar noon_ on April 15,
June 15, and September 1.
{:.tangent}

#### Equatorial-alignment error

For the most accurate readings, the dial of your watch should be parallel to
the plane at the equator which bisects Earth into its two hemispheres. If you
hold your watch horizontally<sup>j</sup> like an amateur, you'll add up to 45°
of error at the edge of the tropics or 21° in northern USA.<sup>k</sup> But if
you can hold it within 6° of proper alignment, a goal easily met by eyeball,
then your maximum directional error due to equatorial misalignment shrinks to
just 2°.

<sup>j</sup> Other instruction on navigating with a watch assumes that equally
spaced markings are suitable for a _horizontal_ sundial. I'm right and [they're
wrong][bicevskis-error].
{:.tangent}

<sup>k</sup> These errors peak on the summer solstice, eastward three hours
before solar noon and westward three hours after.
{:.tangent}

### Where to, then?

Although useful anywhere with sun, watch-based navigation is _particularly_
well suited for a summertime polar expedition. The sun is up all day, the
equatorial plane is conveniently near horizontal, and the sun is on the right
side of it to cast a knife-blade shadow on your dial. Handy, since magnetic
compasses are [useless][compass-failure] inside the polar circles.
