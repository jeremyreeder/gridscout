It took me eleven months, but I finally got last year's
[Independence Day project][project] done.

I love my new bike! I built this Pass Hunter as a 1x11 flat-bar road bike with
a tall stem, 35mm slicks, leather saddle, and a Magura front brake. In lieu of
a rear brake, I routed my fully housed dérailleur cable through the downtube. I
crammed the controls onto a narrow 500mm bar delimited by PDW cork handles. The
VO randonneur rack works nicely for hauling French-toast leftovers home from
breakfast at the bakery, once I acquired a long enough crown bolt for the Pass
Hunter fork's enormous crown. The one part that I kept from my old French-made
Motobécane is the bottle cage, because that's the one part that had nothing
wrong with it. The chainring is oval, a first for me. The bike is fast, comfy,
and fun. It fits me well. I've got 30 miles on it so far.
