## Lockpicking Ranks, Karate-style!

[Lockpickers United][lpu-belts] has a belt-based skill-ranking system. I
discovered this just recently. Over the course of the following week and a
half, I earned the first four ranks: white, yellow, orange, and green. My next
task, a requirement for the blue-belt rank, is to make custom modifications to
a lock to make it more pick-resistant. Fun! I've got some ideas.
